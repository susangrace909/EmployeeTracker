// set up database, connections

//make table with departments, roles, employees

// id auto-incremented and primary key for all (in schema, schema = tables)

// seeds INSERT INTO etc. examples

// index or server in root will have inquire info
	// start with option of view all, add, or update
	// no return, goes to another function after answer selected
	// test with console log to make sure itâ€™s working first, then replace with function
// if answer = this, goes to new function
	//make new function for each thing (view all departments, view all employees
	//console log with function name to make sure it works

// at the end include SELECT *

Easiest was view all departments, need id and department
